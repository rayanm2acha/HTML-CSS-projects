		<h3>YouTube superstar Jake Paul lost his very anticipated fight against boxing legend Tyson Fury's brother Tommy </h3>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/35742686/tommy-fury-hands-jake-paul-first-loss-split-decision-win">
		Jake Paul's unbeaten streak in boxing has come to an end.

		Tommy Fury, the half-brother of heavyweight great Tyson Fury, beat Paul, the YouTuber-turned-prizefighter, via split decision (74-75, 76-73, 76-73) in a close bout on Sunday in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia.

		Fury landed the cleaner shots throughout the fight, but Paul came back with a knockdown in the eighth and final round to make things extremely tight.

		"Tonight, I make my own legacy," Fury said. "I am Tommy Fury."
